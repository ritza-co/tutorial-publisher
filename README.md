# Opinionated tutorial publisher

Programming tutorials consist of three things. Text, images, and code. Text should be readable, images should be pretty, and code should have syntax highlighting. Sounds simple right? It wasn’t as simple as it should be, so I made this.

This publisher lets you write in Markdown and easily make pretty HTML pages with syntax highlighting.

Usually If you want to write a programming tutorial and share it with the world your options are:

1. Upload it to a site like Medium with dark users practices and give up control and let them bloat your content with trackers, paywalls, and dark patterns.
2. Spend a few hours or days yourself setting up something like Hugo with GitHub pages and trying to get the theme to work just right.
3. Use something super minimalistic but not to everyone’s aesthetic taste like https://bearblog.dev/

As a fourth option, you can use this Opinionated Tutorial Publisher in three steps.

1. Write your tutorial in Markdown
2. Run a curl command or upload your markdown on this page
3. Upload the resulting single HTML file anywhere you want
